// The goal for this lab is to draw a triangle mesh loaded from an OBJ file from scratch,
// building on the image drawing code from last week's lab.
// The mesh consists of a list of 3D vertices, that describe the points forming the mesh.
// It also has a list of triangle indices, that determine which vertices are used to form each triangle.
// For now, we will just try to draw all the vertices as points, ignoring the indices.

// *** Your Code Here! ***
// * Task 1: Your first task is actually in the Vector3.hpp file.
//           I've started off a class here to store and manipulate 3D floating-point vectors.
//           We'll need to use this to load and draw the triangle mesh from the OBJ file.
//           Switch over to Vector3.hpp in the Header Files section of this project, and 
//           complete writing the class.

	// I've given you some starter code here that reads through each line of the
	// OBJ file and makes it into a stringstream.
	// The lines containing the vertices start with a 'v', so first check if each line
	// starts with a v.
	// For these V lines, you should load the X, Y and Z coordinates into a new vector
	// and push it back into your array of vertices.

	for (auto& v : vertices) {
		// **** Task 3 ****
		// Finally, let's draw the vertices!
		// For each vertex, we need to call setPixel to draw a point to the screen.
		// You should end up with an output similar to example.png.
		// Hint 1: You just need to use the x and y components of the vectors, you can ignore the z component for now.
		// Hint 2: Note the mesh coordinates range from about -0.5 to 0.5 in each axis (x, y and z). However,
		//         your image coordinates go from 0 to 512. You probably want to add on half of the width and height to move
		//         your vertices towards the centre of the screen, and multiply by a value (about 200 or so) to make the mesh
		//         big enough to see.
