// *** Your Code Here! ***
// * Task 1: I've started off a class here to store and manipulate 3D floating-point vectors.
//           We'll need to use this to load and draw the triangle mesh from the OBJ file.
//           Complete the functions indicated, so we can use the Vector3 class to draw our mesh!

	// This is the default constructor.
	// Change this to set the x, y and z components of the vector to all be zero.
	// You can use an initialiser list, or set them in the constructor function's body.
	Vector3()
	{
		// YOUR CODE HERE
	}

	// This constructor can be used to set the x, y and z components of a vector when it
	// is created. Change this function to set the x_, y_ and z_ members to the values
	// provided.
	Vector3(float x, float y, float z)
	{
		// YOUR CODE HERE

	// Implement this method to add two vectors.
	Vector3 operator+(const Vector3& other) const

	Vector3 operator*(float scalar) const

	// Get a component of the vector
	// This is the index operator - it's the one that is used when a user 
	// indexes part of a vector, for example:
	// myVec[0] = 1.0f; // Set the x component of this vector to 1.
	// Your code should return either x_, y_ or z_, depending on the value of i.
	// If the user tries to access an entry other than 0, 1 or 2, throw an
	// error.

	// I have already written these getters for you.

	// This means that they can be used to modify the values, for example:
	// Vector3 myVec;
	// myVec.x() = 10.0f;
	// The const versions return const references, which don't let you change
	// the value of x_, y_ or z_, so this would produce an error:
	// const Vector3& myVecReference;
	// myVecReference.x() = 10.0f;

// see how it makes use of the operator* you define above.
